                <h1>Fit to iPhone</h1>
                <time>16.06.2020</time>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        So, with the new design I also wanted to test some "features" of iOS where one
                        could imitate the feel of a native app. The idea is to place a shortcut to the
                        website on the homescreen and have a nice icon. When one launches this
                        website-shortcut it should open in a Safari window without address-bar and properly
                        colored statusbar.
                        <a href="https://medium.com/appscope/designing-native-like-progressive-web-apps-for-ios-1b3cdda1d0e8">
                            Appscope
                        </a>
                        has a short article on how to do that.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        For the new, second design I did not use a splashscreen, though I did add them by now (also
                        using the splashscreen generator linked in the article above).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After I fiddled out how this has to be done I was quite happy that it looked how I expected it.
                        But after looking onto it again I found one thing I really didn't like: the logo in the top
                        left corner. While I like the logo itself, even though it's very simple, I don't like how it
                        looks in this "native-like" website-shortcut.
                    </p>

                    <div class="article-images">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="assets/images/2nd_design_iphone_se2_portrait.png"
                                 alt="Screenshot iPhone SE2 Portrait Mode">
                            <figcaption>
                                Portrait mode on iPhone SE2
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="assets/images/2nd_design_iphone_se2_landscape.png"
                                 alt="Screenshot iPhone SE2 Landscape Mode">
                            <figcaption>
                                Landscape mode on iPhone SE2
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        When turning the phone to landscape everything is fine, the status bar of the phone disappears
                        and the design does not break. But in portrait mode, the mode I use most, it looks horrible to
                        have this little extra bar above the logo.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This annoyed me so much, that I had to remove the logo and replace it by something different -
                        the rainbow color line - immediately. You can see the result. The result looks somewhat boring.
                        I kept the colors, but something is missing now.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Somehow and somewhen the logo will return!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Edit: I don't know why, but the images don't show up. Grr

                    <p>
                        Given that I wanted to publish updates to this site and work on design stuff regularly, it
                        took me half a year to actually do something again after Christmas.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        What I did is a complete overhaul of the site, which is not really big (as the site itself
                        was never really big). But I liked working on it. Next step will be generating the pixel-logo
                        from JavaScript instead of manually building it in CSS - that was fun though. (If you cannot
                        see the logo in the top left corner your browser does not support CSS Grid).

                <section>
                    Usually I would push changes only when they finished something I wanted to achieve. For this little
                    project I decided to also push and therefore publish work-in-progess changes. The only rule I will
                    keep is: don't push if it's broken.

                <h1>Fine tuning</h1>
                <time>29.12.2019</time>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        While I wanted to concentrate on the general ideas of design and more on the structuring of
                        content I quickly fell into the deep whole of fine tuning details, like the margin between the
                        heading of this site and the line below it, which looks different on my Mac and on my Windows 10
                        machine, both running firefox.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Maybe I should write a list of the things I want to have on this site. I can implement those
                        things then and hopefully do not jump between the things. So here it goes:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Sidenav for my "articles", like shown on <a
                                href="https://css-tricks.com/sticky-smooth-active-nav/">CSS Tricks</a></li>
                        <li>Highlight of the active article should pick up the underlined-with-box-element</li>
                        <li><s>Bullet points for lists should also use the square as a marker</s></li>
                        <li><s>Make spacing between list items bigger</s></li>
                        <li>Use better sans-serif font</li>
                        <li>In mobile view (iPhone SE) put sticky headers for articles instead of sidenav</li>
                        <li>Instead of todo-list here, create issues</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <h1>Development HTTP Server</h1>
                <time>26.12.2019</time>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        For developing this website I needed a simple way to test it. Since it is just a plain HTML file
                        with some CSS I could just open the file in the browser. But to see how it looks on the iPhone
                        (besides the responsive mode of the browser) I needed running server the phone could connect to.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        A quick google took me to <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server">MDN</a>.
                        The article shows that Python3's built in HTTP Server is just enough. Having Pyhton already
                        installed serving the website to the iPhone was quick.

                <h1>Beginning Layout</h1>
                <time>25.12.2019</time>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        This text and the HTML and CSS it is embedded in and represented by marks the beginning of my
                        path of learning these technologies and specifically aspects of design and layout.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        For the beginning, I will try to keep it simple and do not use any browser-specific CSS. Though
                        I
                        have some ideas of what I want to achieve I do not have any specific structure in mind or focus
                        on
                        specific aspects of design I want to implement. I will start out with using the different
                        display
                        options, grid for example, to lay out the content I write.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Because I use an iPhone SE I will try to use media queries to fit this device.
