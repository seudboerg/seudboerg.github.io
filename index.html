                This text and the HTML and CSS it is embedded in and represented by marks the beginning of my
                path of learning these technologies and specifically aspects of design and layout.

                <p>
                    For the beginning, I will try to keep it simple and do not use any browser-specific CSS. Though I
                    have some ideas of what I want to achieve I do not have any specific structure in mind or focus on
                    specific aspects of design I want to implement. I will start out with using the different display
                    options, grid for example, to lay out the content I write.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because I use an iPhone SE I will try to use media queries to fit this device.

                For developing this website I needed a simple way to test it. Since it is just a plain HTML file
                with some CSS I could just open the file in the browser. But to see how it looks on the iPhone
                (besides the responsive mode of the browser) I needed running server the phone could connect to.

                <p>
                    A quick google took me to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server">MDN</a>.
                    The article shows that Python3's built in HTTP Server is just enough. Having Pyhton already installed
                    serving the website to the iPhone was quick.
