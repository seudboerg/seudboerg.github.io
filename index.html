                While I wanted to concentrate on the general ideas of design and more on the structuring of
                content I quickly fell into the deep whole of fine tuning details, like the margin between the
                heading of this site and the line below it, which looks different on my Mac and on my Windows 10
                machine, both running firefox.

                <p>
                    Maybe I should write a list of the things I want to have on this site. I can implement those
                    things then and hopefully do not jump between the things. So here it goes:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sidenav for my "articles", like shown on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/sticky-smooth-active-nav/">CSS Tricks</a> </li>
                    <li>Highlight of the active article should pick up the underlined-with-box-element</li>
                    <li><s>Bullet points for lists should also use the square as a marker</s></li>
                    <li><s>Make spacing between list items bigger</s></li>
                    <li>Use better sans-serif font</li>
                    <li>In mobile view (iPhone SE) put sticky headers for articles instead of sidenav</li>
                    <li>Instead of todo-list here, create issues</li>
                </ul>

                For developing this website I needed a simple way to test it. Since it is just a plain HTML file
                with some CSS I could just open the file in the browser. But to see how it looks on the iPhone
                (besides the responsive mode of the browser) I needed running server the phone could connect to.

                <p>
                    A quick google took me to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server">MDN</a>.
                    The article shows that Python3's built in HTTP Server is just enough. Having Pyhton already installed
                    serving the website to the iPhone was quick.

                This text and the HTML and CSS it is embedded in and represented by marks the beginning of my
                path of learning these technologies and specifically aspects of design and layout.

                <p>
                    For the beginning, I will try to keep it simple and do not use any browser-specific CSS. Though I
                    have some ideas of what I want to achieve I do not have any specific structure in mind or focus on
                    specific aspects of design I want to implement. I will start out with using the different display
                    options, grid for example, to lay out the content I write.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because I use an iPhone SE I will try to use media queries to fit this device.
